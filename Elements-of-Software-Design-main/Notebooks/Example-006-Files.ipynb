    "It is relatively simple to to do file manipulation in Python. To process a file it has to be opened. Python offers 3 modes for opening a file - read (\"r\"), write (\"w\"), and append (\"a\"). The syntax for opening a file is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  fileVar = open (\"fileName\", \"mode\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  in_file = open (\"input.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To close a file simply do\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "* If you open a file in write mode and there is already an existing file then the original contents get over-written. \n",
