General Study Guide for Course Elements of Software Design CS313e

Preparation for Class

Read the notes posted online for the day.
Read the relevant sections in the book. Each day's reading is given in the schedule.
You do not have to understand everything that you read. Make a list of questions. ASK in class!
Follow Up After Class

Try out a few of the programming exercises in GeeksForGeeks, LeetCode, or Kattis.
If you have problems, visit the TAs during office hours. Sign up and we will help you with your program.
If you are not programming, you are not studying.
Your study time will be approximately 10 hours per week. Schedule your time accordingly.
